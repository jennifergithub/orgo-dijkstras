        <p>Hello! This website is built for rudimentary, one- to four-step synthesis problems in introductory organic chemistry courses. Please stay tuned for updates, including stereochemical/regiochemical outcomes, mechanism names, a visual map, and more reagents!</p>
        <p>Note that depending on what you choose as your starting reagent, you may get a lot of "Path not found!". Also, since this is intended for introductory courses only, some synthetic pathways may seem a bit long-winded when there may be other shorter ways we haven't learned about yet.</p>
        <p>The science behind finding the optimal reaction pathway comes from Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's takes in a weighted, directed graph and calculates the shortest path from a starting vertex (the starting reagent) to every other vertex in the graph. From there, the algorithm can find all the intermediates.</p>
