# orgo-dijkstras
Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in synthesis problems.

As of 11/22/22: added the map that's hosted on Heroku. Will be unavailable on November 28, but will try to get that fixed over break.

As of 11/5/22: added some nodes and edges pertaining to carboxylic acid derivative chemistry. Added graph.ipynb to build a map with NetworkX and graphviz. Would be great if visualization can become interactive, maybe find an alternative with cytoscape.

As of 8/10/21: added stereochemical/regiochemical outcomes and changed the layout from flex to grid. Spent hours to get the buttons to work. Still need to incorporate the Markovnikov and anti-Markovnikov, syn and anti outcomes.

As of 8/8/21: changed the code to JavaScript so it's easier to deploy on the web. Still need to add stereochemical/regiochemical considerations and more mechanisms.
