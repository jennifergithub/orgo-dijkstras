# orgo-dijkstras
Using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in synthesis problems.

To-Do List:
- DisplayEdge method: add edges instead to the string? Change toString method for edge to include reagents
- Refactor createDirectedGraph
- Change all the data of vertices to lowercase and add that .toLowerCase() method somewhere
- Consider regiochemistry and stereochemistry
- Add more mechanisms
